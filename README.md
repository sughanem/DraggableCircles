# Draggable Circels

 We have 4 elements: 1 red square, 1 blue square, 1 red circle and 1 blue circle:

* The user must be able to "drag&drop" the 2 circles.
* If the circle is placed over the square of the same color, we position the circle in the middle of the square (and afterwards we can no longer drag the circle).
* In any other case the circle returns to its initial position (after the drop).
